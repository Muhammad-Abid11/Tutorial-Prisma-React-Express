# React Todo App with Tailwind CSS

This project is a **CRUD Todo application** built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update (Toggle completion), and Delete tasks.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, responsive design.

## Setup & Configuration

To enable the styling architecture, we installed and configured the following libraries:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

These tools are configured to provide a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
